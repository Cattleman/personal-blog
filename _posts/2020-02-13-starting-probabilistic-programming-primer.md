# Starting Probabilistic Programming - with Probabilistic Programming Primer Course!

[Probablistic Programming Primer](https://product.peadarcoyle.com/)

## My motivation

I am motivated to build my intuition about probability and how to apply probabilistic thinking to decision making. Like many, I am heavily influenced by Taleb's Icerto and seek to better understand uncertainty in the World.

## Enter pymc3

I first encountered pymc3 through blogs on the Quantopian trading environment/ platform.  The notion that I could build models that shine a dim light around the "truth" appeals to me. I dove into Thomas Wiecki's [blog](https://twiecki.io/), but for the most part, it went over my head at the time. 

Since then I got my feet wet with Pymc3 through Eric Ma and Hugo Bowne's awesome 2018 scipy conference video tutorial: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89ye2hfsAsk). Over a weekend I went through (quickly) the video and associated exercises. 

I decided to follow as many of the pycm3 core devs that I could find on twitter. I've learned a lot from being a fly-on-the-wall of their various threads. Through twitter, I found George Ho's awesome blog **Eigenfoo**: [Here](https://eigenfoo.xyz/). 

Another pymc3 dev I follow is is Peadar Coyle. I appreciate his perspective on all things stats/tech - Go Audio! I've also been salivating over his [Probablistic Programming Primer](https://product.peadarcoyle.com/) course since he introduced it. 

## Probabilistic Programming Primer

First off - Thank you, Peadar for giving me the opportunity to take this course for free. I really appreciate the opportunity.

I am excited to take this course to help me better understand how to structure the model development process and build my statistical intuition.

## What I hope to learn

- How do practitioners think through selecting the distribution of priors?
- How do I measure the performance of a probabilistic model?
- How do I diagnose issues in my model?
- How can I better communicate the results of a probabilistic model to stakeholders?
- What is a trace?


My plan is to work through the course over the next month with sporadic updates on my progress and a-ha moments along the way. At the end of the course, I'll return to the questions above and share what I've learned and where I got confused.
