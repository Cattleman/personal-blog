# Descartes Labs Geospatial Platform Webinar

**Website:** [https://www.descarteslabs.com/](https://www.descarteslabs.com/)

This past week I attended a half-hour Descartes Labs (DL) webinar to get an overview of the platform. I've been following DL for a few years now after learning about them from Planet, a satellite data company. DL has built a python api that makes the Planet satellite data very accessible as well as aggregating other satellite data sources like Landsat. 

In addition to access to data, DL offers managed compute resources like a hosted jupyter labs instance for data scientists to build workflows. It wasn't clear to me if customers can also schedule workflows and leverage DL's managed resource too, but I would expect that's the case. 

It sounds like there are a few subscription tiers that offer more access to data sets and compute.   

Overall I was really impressed by the api and pre-processing that DL does. The platform standardizes various projections from different satellites to allow users to work with data in a common basis. I think that is a big selling point for my use-case because it provides a much richer data-set AND is data prep I don't have to do myself.

I am looking forward to diving into the data and further explore the API. 

**Questions:**

1. Does the API / service support custom data-set creation?
2. If I want to use a data labeling service like [figure-eight]([https://www.figure-eight.com/](https://www.figure-eight.com/)) what is the best way to export images? 
3. For custom data-sets how does IP / ownership work?

**Next step:** 
* Reach out to sales and get more specifics on the various subscription tiers.
