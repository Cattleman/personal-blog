            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # single-value selection over [Major_Genre, MPAA_Rating] pairs # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(movies).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) . Example 2: Tooltips . alt.Chart(movies).mark_circle().add_selection( alt.selection_interval(bind=&#39;scales&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, axis=alt.Axis(minExtent=30)), # use min extent to stabilize axis title placement tooltip=[&#39;Title:N&#39;, &#39;Release_Date:N&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;] ).properties( width=600, height=400 ) . Example 3: More Tooltips . # select a point for which to provide details-on-demand label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=700, height=400 ) . Data Tables . You can display tables per the usual way in your blog: . movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; df = pd.read_json(movies) # display table with pandas df[[&#39;Title&#39;, &#39;Worldwide_Gross&#39;, &#39;Production_Budget&#39;, &#39;Distributor&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating&#39;]].head() .

            "title": "Descartes Labs Geospatial Platform Webinar",
            "content": "Descartes Labs Geospatial Platform Webinar . Website: https://www.descarteslabs.com/ . This past week I attended a half-hour Descartes Labs (DL) webinar to get an overview of the platform. I’ve been following DL for a few years now after learning about them from Planet, a satellite data company. DL has built a python api that makes the Planet satellite data very accessible as well as aggregating other satellite data sources like Landsat. . In addition to access to data, DL offers managed compute resources like a hosted jupyter labs instance for data scientists to build workflows. It wasn’t clear to me if customers can also schedule workflows and leverage DL’s managed resource too, but I would expect that’s the case. . It sounds like there are a few subscription tiers that offer more access to data sets and compute. . Overall I was really impressed by the api and pre-processing that DL does. The platform standardizes various projections from different satellites to allow users to work with data in a common basis. I think that is a big selling point for my use-case because it provides a much richer data-set AND is data prep I don’t have to do myself. . I am looking forward to diving into the data and further explore the API. . Questions: . Does the API / service support custom data-set creation? | If I want to use a data labeling service like figure-eight what is the best way to export images? | For custom data-sets how does IP / ownership work? | Next step: . Reach out to sales and get more specifics on the various subscription tiers. | .",

            "title": "AWS Innovate - ML Online Conference",
            "content": "AWS Innovate: ML Online Conference . Last week I attended the AWS Innovate: ML online Conference. . Website: https://aws.amazon.com/events/aws-innovate/machine-learning/ . While I work in AWS ecosystem, I don’t have much exposure to the ML products/services and tools that AWS provides. This conference was a good way to get broad exposure to the various options and solutions AWS provides. I will admit that as I was watching various sessions I was working and chatting with collogues that were also watching various sessions. . Sessions I attended . Automate machine Learning: From Debugging DL to detecting model drift in Prod. | Simplify and accelerate time-series forecasting and real-time personalization | Amazon Kendra: Reinvent enterprise search and interact with data using AI | Large scale image and video analysis with Amazon Rekognition | My Take-aways . This session was fairly basic and addressed DL debugging tools that AWS SageMaker has to diagnose various issues with your model. The case-study was focused on vanishing gradient problem. For those unfamiliar, the vanishing gradient problem is when the gradients get very small. When the gradient is used to update the weight value there is almost no update so no learning can occur. (think of multiplying two small numbers, 0.1 * 0.1=0.01) The tooling that AWS provides for debugging DL models is really cool - I would definitely use it if I worked in SageMaker. Another part of this session was addressing drift. However, the example they used was to monitor the covariate shift /distribution of live data and verify that it has a similar distribution to the training data. I think of that more as a monitoring/validation check than drift. | I caught the last third of the time-series session. This was very validating because AWS’ product approaches time-series forecasting the same way I have been recently. They introduced a pyramid with classic methods at the base - ARIMA, GARCH, VEC STS. Then the middle tier was Facebook Prophet https://facebook.github.io/prophet/ which I first started using when it was released in 2017. (I recommend reading the paper: Forecasting at Scale: https://peerj.com/preprints/3190/). The top of the pyramid is an RNN - I am guessing AWS means a family of sequence models. My only exposure to RNNs has been in various tutorials - a major downside is the lack of interpretability which most business-cases desire. One question that came up was How much data do I need for RNNs (LSTM, GRU etc.)? | Amazon Kendra is a really exciting product. It’s ostensibly very simple - the combo of search and NLP. My head exploded with applications for Kendra at work and for various personal projects. . At work: Could we use Kendra to help make all the disparate docs and wiki’s more accessible and queryable? . Personal projects: Could I use Kendra to make all my online interactions queryable? . | Amazon Rekognition is AWS’ semi-automated computer vision / classification framework. They have a set of pre-trained models that you can leverage to label your own images and the capacity to build your own datasets and use transfer learning / tuning for custom projects. | AWS splits image analysis into three categories: Exemplar, Classification and Localization. Exemplar problems use a dataset of specific items you want to identify in other images. Your NN is trained on those images and inference is identifying if the item is present and if so what is the bounding box. A use-case they provide was brand recognition. . Classification - Think of classic MNIST use-cases. . Localization - Where your data includes bounding boxes. . Another part of the Rekognition stack was how to leverage a positive-feedback loop so that humans-in-the-loop can improve the dataset that is used to train subsequent versions of the model. I thought this was a valuable point because it helps people consider the data-flywheel from the get-go. The first version doesn’t need to have awesome F1 score if you have a process to improve the model as it serves inferences! . Overall, I thought the online conference was a good use of time - It’s helpful to see how AWS characterizes these various problem spaces and to see how each of the solutions fits in the ecosystem. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
