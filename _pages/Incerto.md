# Incerto

## What is Incerto?
Incerto is a body of work by Nassim Nicholas Taleb focused on uncertainty.

One of my goals for 2020 is to re-read the books and jot down my thoughts.
I've re-read many of these over the past few years, but my perspective has changed in the last couple of years.

# Fooled by Randomness

some thoughts from my head right after finishing: 

- **Skeptic**
    - Update your belief slowly with new info (bayesian)
- Don't marry an idea or belief - you can change your mind!
- We get cases of conditional probability wrong - It's complicated!
- Humans anchor on specifics - $10 mil if you die in 10 years VS $10 mil if you die in a car crash in 10 years. We can imagine the car crash so we're more inclined to think it can happen. Imagining out death, however it happens, is difficult

**Specifics from the book where I folded the page (paraphrased):** 

1. **Ergodicity** - It means, that under certain conditions, that very long sample-path would end up resembling each other. Think Janitor's lottery wealth (fools-luck) vs dentist's. P.57
2. Owing to abrupt rare events, we do not live in a world where things "converge" continuously towards betterment. Nor do things in life move continuously at all. NATURE DOES INFACT MAKE JUMPS. P.95
3. Survivorship bias is dependent on the size of the initial population. Recall Taleb's experiment with 10,000 managers. A track record has less relevance than we think. (p. 156)
4. (1) We do not think when making choices but use heuristics (2) We make serious probabilistic mistakes in today's world - whatever the true reason.  Also - 2200 years was not long ago. We are all Romans/greeks/Mongols. p.198
5. Option blindness - What has more value? (a) a contract that pays $1m if the market goes down 10% on any given day in the next year; (b) a contract that pays you $  m if the stock market goes down 10% on any given day next year due to a terrorist act? I expect most ppl choose (b) (Anchor on specifics) p.210
6. Wax in my ears  
7. Say you own a painting you bought for 20k, the art market now values it at 40k. would you still acquire the painting at 40k? If not, you're married to the position. There is no rational reason to keep the painting if you would not buy it at its current rate - only an emotional investment. Beliefs are said to be path-dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates. p.240
